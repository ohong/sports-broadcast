**AI Sports Commentary Generator - Project Description**

**What it does:**
An AI-powered app that automatically generates professional-quality play-by-play commentary for amateur sports footage. Users upload video or paste a YouTube link, and within minutes receive their footage with broadcast-style narration overlaid—no editing skills required.

**Target user:**
Parents of youth athletes (ages 8-16) who film games but lack the time or expertise to add commentary. These parents want to preserve memories and share impressive moments with family, but raw silent footage feels incomplete. They're willing to pay $5-15 per video to transform their iPhone recordings into something that sounds like ESPN coverage.

**Core user flow:**
1. Upload video file or paste social media link
2. Select sport type (basketball, soccer, baseball, tennis, etc.)
3. AI analyzes footage, identifies key moments (goals, assists, defensive plays)
4. Generates natural commentary matching the action timing
5. User downloads video with commentary mixed in, ready to share

**Technical approach:**
Computer vision models detect players, ball position, and significant events. Large language models generate contextually appropriate commentary based on detected actions. Text-to-speech creates natural-sounding narration with appropriate energy levels (calm during slow play, excited during scoring). Audio mixing ensures commentary doesn't overpower crowd noise or coach instructions.

**Why this works:**
Parents already film constantly but struggle to make footage watchable. Current options require either: (a) manually recording yourself narrating, which feels awkward, or (b) hiring video editors at $100+ per project. We eliminate both friction points. The AI doesn't need to be perfect—it needs to be "good enough" that grandparents enjoy watching and kids feel special.

**Go-to-market:**
Launch with basketball and soccer (highest youth participation rates). Partner with youth sports leagues to offer team packages. Price at $9.99 per video or $29.99/month for unlimited. Initial distribution through Facebook groups for youth sports parents and Instagram ads showing before/after clips.

**Expansion potential:**
Once established with parents, expand to: high school athletics departments creating highlight reels for recruiting, adult recreational leagues, extreme sports content creators, and potentially real-time commentary for live-streamed amateur games.

**Success metrics:**
30% of users who upload one video return to purchase a second within 30 days. This indicates the output quality justifies the price and that sharing the first video created positive social feedback.
